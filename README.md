# Espers
Our wad project's name is :  Espers   
It is an audio book commerce site.  The idea came from the following question: Why to  spent a day reading a book, when you can hear it? Or why to waste traveling time, without hearing   something you desire or can be useful for   yourself. 
All the kinds of books exist on our web app, the user can pick whatever he/she wants from a   large list.  
All the products and the users are registered inside a DB. 
A user can save his/her books. The audio book   works only if the user is logged in with a valid   account.  
Other features: 
- rate books 
- add other user friends 
- can leave comments 
- send book
